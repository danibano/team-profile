# Team Profile

## Description

This generates a webpage that displays a user's team basic info. It's a command line application that prompts the user to enter information about their team members. It will include information such as their name, id, and email, and depending on the role either their office number, GitHub username or the school they went too. I learned a lot about using classes, constructors and using jest.
